Finding Trudeau (FT) is a simple application for crawling `CNN` and `Twitter` looking for any news and tweets about *Justin Trudeau*. 
Plus, you can generate **`word cloud`** from the most important topics and keywords from Mr. Trudeau's tweets!

### Fetching Posts

Fetching Posts from supported providers, `CNN` and `Twitter`: [Test Api](https://findingtrudeau.sakku.cloud/post)

```sh
curl -X GET \
  'https://localhost:8080/post?limitation=30&type=CNN' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
```

Below table describes available params:

| Parameter      |   Type                    | required | default             | describe |
| ---------------| ------------------------- | :------: | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| limitation     | `int`                     | NO       | 25                  | maximum number of returned             |
| type           | `CNN`, `TWITTER`, or `ALL`| NO       | `ALL`               | filter returned values by provider     |
| from           | `date`                    | NO       | A year ago          | oldest result date                     |
| to             | `date`                    | NO       | Current time        | newest result date                     |

Sample output:

> ```$xslt
> {
>   "error": false,
>    "message": "Ok",
>    "result": {
>        "posts": {
>            "TWITTER": [

## How to build the application

1. Run `mvn clean install` to build your application

2. Start the application with `java -jar target/findingtrudeau-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml`
   
    * Docker image of the application is available on the hub: `docker run -d makbn/finding_trudeau:latest` 

3. To check that your application is running enter URL `http://localhost:8080`


* In order to develop this project you need to install `lombok` plugin on your editor.
* Docker Image `latest` tag is built from `master` branch with every change on this branch.


## Components

FT contains multiple functional components:

 * `Web-Service`: this layer is implemented on the top of `Dropwizard` and `Jersy`. The application entry point is `io.github.makbn.FindingTruedeauApplication`. services are placed inside `core` package as Dropwizard standard arch type. In order to use dependency injection (HK2) you need to change the `ApplicationBinder` class.
 * `Crawler`: crawlers are implemented from the `Crawler` interface in order to add extendability to the system. if you want to add another provider you need to add a `PostType` and implement a new crawler from the `Crawle` interface. 
 * `scheduled-jobs`: as the metrics of application show, the response time of CNN search is more than 30Sec in some cases and also validating each news is for high load takes some time. So, in order to cut this time a **`scheduled job`** runs each 2 minutes to fetch and cache data.


## Technologies
 * **Java 8 SE**: FT is powered by lovely Java version 8 and maven
 * **Dropwizard**: This application is based on `Dropwizard` framework.
 * **HK2**: For dependency injection
